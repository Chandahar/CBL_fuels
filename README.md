Github repository for group 25 to collaborate on matlab code in course 4CBLB10: "Sustainable Fuels: Plan A or B?".

To collaborate in a fruitful manner, I would like all of us to use the same coding standards. Please make sure to document your work in the "log.txt" file. Remember to add comments to every github commit. Finally, please comment your code and make it clear enough for every member to pick up easily.

To add the repository to your Matlab create an empty folder and follow steps from my SSA
